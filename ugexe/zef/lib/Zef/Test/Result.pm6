# Zef::Test::Result represents a single test file and the results of running it.
# Pass an unstarted Proc::Async object. $file can likely be removed as a constructor 
# and parsed from $process.args or $process.stdout.
# 
# method status
# Get the exit code of the process that ran the tests.
#
# method ok
# Convenience method. Returns `True` if the exit code was 0 (success). Otherwise, `False`.
