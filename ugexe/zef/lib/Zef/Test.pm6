# Zef::Test should have $!path set to the base of a module's repo/directory. This is used for 2 things:
# 1) Automatically grepping all `.t` files recursively.
# 2) Setting the $CWD to run the tests in the directory they expect.
# - :@test-files: Skip search for test files and run only these instead.
# - :@includes: add `lib`s via -`I$include`. Defaults to `("$!path/blib", $!path/lib")`
#

# Create a supply of Zef::Test::Result objects. Each Zef::Test::Result object has a `.promise` attribute
# that may be inspected for completion, output, and exit status.
