=TITLE Entering Unicode Characters

=SUBTITLE Input methods for unicode characters in editors and the shell

Perl 6 allows the use of unicode characters as variable names.  Many
operators are defined with unicode symbols (in particular the L<set/bag
operators|/language/setbagmix#Set%2FBag_Operators>) as well as some quoting
constructs.  Hence it is good to know how to enter these symbols into editors,
the Perl 6 shell and the command line, especially if the symbols aren't
available as actual characters on a keyboard.

General information about entering unicode under various operating systems
and environments can be found on the Wikipedia L<unicode input
page|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_input>.

=head1 Editors and shells

=head2 Vim

In L<Vim|http://www.vim.org/>, unicode characters are entered (in
insert-mode) by pressing first C<Ctrl-V> (also denoted C<^V>), then C<u> and
then the hexadecimal value of the unicode character to be entered.  For
example, the Greek letter λ (lambda) is entered via the key combination:

    ^Vu03BB

Further information about entering special characters in Vim can be found on
the Vim Wikia page about L<entering special
characters|http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Entering_special_characters>.

=head2 Emacs

In L<Emacs|http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/>, unicode characters are
entered by first entering the chord C<Ctrl-x 8 Enter> at which point the
text C<Unicode (name or hex):> appears in the mode line.  One then enters
the unicode code point hexadecimal number followed by the enter key.  The
unicode character will now appear in the document.  Thus, to enter the Greek
letter λ (lambda), one uses the following key combination (whitespace has
been added between the commands for clarity):

    Ctrl-x 8 Enter 3bb Enter

Further information about unicode and its entry into Emacs can be found on
the L<Unicode Encoding Emacs wiki
page|http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/UnicodeEncoding>.

=head2 Unix shell

At the bash shell, one enters unicode characters by using entering
C<Ctrl-Shift-u>, then the unicode code point value followed by enter.  For
instance, to enter the character for the element-of operator (∈) use the
following key combination (whitespace has been added for clarity):

    Ctrl-Shift-u 2208 Enter

This also the method one would use to enter unicode characters into the
C<perl6> REPL, if one has started the REPL inside a Unix shell.

=head1 Unicode characters useful in Perl 6

=head2 L<Guillemets|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillemet>

These characters are used in French and German as quotation marks.  In Perl
6 they are also used as quotation marks (in POD as an alternative to the
angle brackets and in normal code as an alternative to double quotes) as
well as to denote the hyperoperators.  The symbols and their unicode hex
values are as follows:

=begin table
    symbol   unicode code point   ascii equivalent
    ------   ------------------   ----------------
    «        U+00AB               <<
    »        U+00BB               >>
=end table

Thus constructs such as these are now possible:

    C« fixed-width POD text »
    say (1, 2) »+« (3, 4);     # 4 6 ; element-wise add
    @array »+=» 42;            # add 42 to each element of @array
    say «moo»;                 # moo
    my $baa = 123; say «$baa»; # 123

=head2 Set/bag operators

The L<set/bag operators|/language/setbagmix#Set%2FBag_Operators> operators all
have set-theory-related symbols, the unicode code points and their ascii
equivalents are listed below.  To compose such a character, it is merely
necessary to enter the character composition chord (e.g. C<Ctrl-V u> in Vim;
C<Ctrl-Shift-u> in Bash) then the unicode code point hexadecimal number.

=begin table
    operator   unicode code point   ascii equivalent
    --------   ------------------   ----------------
    ∈          U+2208               (elem)
    ∉          U+2209               !(elem)
    ∋          U+220B               (cont)
    ∌          U+220C               !(cont)
    ⊆          U+2286               (<=)
    ⊈          U+2288               !(<=)
    ⊂          U+2282               (<)
    ⊄          U+2284               !(<)
    ⊇          U+2287               (>=)
    ⊉          U+2289               !(>=)
    ⊃          U+2283               (>)
    ⊅          U+2285               !(>)
    ≼          U+227C               (<+)
    ≽          U+227D               (>+)
    ∪          U+222A               (|)
    ∩          U+2229               (&)
    ∖          U+2216               (-)
    ⊖          U+2296               (^)
    ⊍          U+228D               (.)
    ⊎          U+228E               (+)
=end table

=head2 Mathematical symbols

Wikipedia contains a full list of L<mathematical operators and symbols in
unicode|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_operators_and_symbols_in_Unicode>
as well as links to their mathematical meaning.

=head2 Greek characters

Greek characters may be used as variable names.  For a list of Greek and
Coptic characters and their unicode code points see the L<Greek in Unicode
Wikipedia article|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_alphabet#Greek_in_Unicode>.

For example, to assign the value 3 to π, enter the following in Vim
(whitespace added to the compose sequences for clarity):

=for code :allow<B>
    my $B<Ctrl-V u 03C0> = 3;  # same as: my $π = 3;
    say $B<Ctrl-V u 03C0>;     # 3    same as: say $π;

=end pod
