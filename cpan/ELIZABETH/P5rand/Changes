    - Added original Perl 5 documentation

0.0.2  2018-05-08T09:41:27+02:00
    - Removed support for srand().
      As Grinzz has pointed out on #perl, I got the semantics of srand()
      wrong.  The correct semantics are the same with Perl 6 except for the
      srand() version, which would be a bad idea to mimic in Perl 6.
