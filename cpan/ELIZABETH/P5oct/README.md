NAME
====

P5oct - Implement Perl 5's oct() built-in [DEPRECATED]

SYNOPSIS
========

    use P5oct; # exports oct()

DESCRIPTION
===========

This module tries to mimic the behaviour of the `oct` of Perl 5 as closely as possible. It has been deprecated in favour of the `P5hex` module, which exports both `oct` and `hex`. Please use that module instead of this one.
