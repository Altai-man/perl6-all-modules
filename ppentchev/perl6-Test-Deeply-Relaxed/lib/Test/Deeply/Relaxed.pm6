Test::Deeply::Relaxed - Compare two complex data structures loosely

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=begin code
    use Test;
    use Test::Deeply::Relaxed;

    is-deeply-relaxed 'foo', 'foo';
    isnt-deeply-relaxed 'foo', 'bar';

    is-deeply-relaxed 5, 5;
    isnt-deeply-relaxed 5, '5';

    is-deeply-relaxed [1, 2, 3], Array[Int:D].new(1, 2, 3);

    is-deeply-relaxed {:a("foo"), :b("bar")}, Hash[Str:D].new({ :a("foo"), :b("bar") });

    # And now for the one that made me write this...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<Test:::Deeply::Relaxed> module provides the C<is-deeply-relaxed()>
and C<isnt-deeply-relaxed()> functions that do not check the state of
mind of the passed objects, but instead compare their structure in depth
similarly to C<is-deeply()>, but a bit more loosely.  In particular, they
ignore the differences between typed and untyped collections, e.g. they
will consider an array and an explicit C<Array[Str:D]> to be the same if
the strings contained within are indeed the same.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=begin item1
sub is-deeply-relaxed

    sub is-deeply-relaxed($got, $expected, $name = Str, Bool:D :$cache = False)

Compare the two data structures in depth similarly to C<is-deeply()>,
but a bit more loosely.

If the C<:cache> flag is specified, the cache of values will be used for
any iterable objects that support it.  This allows the caller to later
examine the sequences further.

Current API available since version 0.1.0.
=end item1

=begin item1
sub isnt-deeply-relaxed

    sub isnt-deeply-relaxed($got, $expected, $name = Str, Bool:D :$cache = False)

The opposite of C<is-deeply-relaxed()> - fail if the two structures
are loosely the same.

Current API available since version 0.1.0.
