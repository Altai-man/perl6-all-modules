    Release 0.0.7
    - [PDF::DAO::Doc] add saves-as( :update ) option.
      The input PDF is copied to the destination PDF, which is then incrementally
      updated. This should generally be faster.
    
    Release 0.0.6
    - [bin/pdf-rewriter.pl] unbust rewriting/recompression of encrypted PDFs
    - [PDF::Storage::Serializer][PDF::DAO::{Array|Dict|Stream}] use Perl 6 object hashes
      -- Refactored `my %h; ...; %hash{$object.WHICH}` with `my %h{Any}; ...; %hash{$object}` 
         (See http://doc.perl6.org/type/Hash#Object_hashes_and_type_constraints)
      
    - [PDF::DAO::Doc]
      -- added $doc.ast method. factored out from $doc.save-as
      -- Added $doc.Str method; for in-memory serialization
      -- $doc.save-as($target); # can now be file-name, io-path, or io-handle
      -- added $.update( :annex(...) ) option.
      This allows the update body to be saved to separate 'annex' file, as an
      alternative to appending to the original PDF.
      
      Useful in a mail-merge scenario where multiple documents are being produced
      from a common template and each can be reconstituted by appending the
      annex file to the original template.

      Possible further work:
      -- JSON output of annex files
      -- add `$doc.open( $file, :annex)` option - load a base pdf, then apply
         an annex file.
    - [PDF::Reader] bug-fixes:
      -- avoid encrypting the encryption dictionary
      -- fixed de-Linearization. Now handled by PDF::Storage::Serializer
    - [PDF::Storage::Filter] bug fixes:
      -- fixed ascii-85, ascii-hex and run-length encoders to add
         end-of-data markers
      -- withdrew LZW encoding

    - renamed META.info => META6.json
    - changed $.delegator.find-delegate method
