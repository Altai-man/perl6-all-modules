# Data-StaticTable

The StaticTable provides a way to handle bidimensional data in a fashion somewhat similar to a spreadsheet

  * Columns have names
  * Rows have numbers, starting from 1
  
The name Static comes from the fact that, after creation, you can not add or remove elements from it. If you want to do that, you can take a subset from it to create another one

A Query object is provided to perform searches using the native perl6 grep over columns, and handle indexes automatically.
